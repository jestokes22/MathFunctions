# MathFunctions
This repository is meant to serve as practice for modeling mathematical functions with varying degrees of difficulty.
There will be functions written in multiple languages, from Python and C to Javascript and Java.
The goal is to create concise ways to model functions and mathematical procedures in a way that is useable on a computer.
